# graph-libs
Stashing graph libraries I come across (mostly just Python ones)

## Graph kernels/comparisons
- [graphkit-learn](https://github.com/jajupmochi/graphkit-learn)
  - "A python package for graph kernels, graph edit distances, and graph pre-image problem."
  
## Graph neural networks
- [GraphGallery](https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/GraphGallery)
  - "GraphGallery is a gallery for benchmarking Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Adversarial Learning with TensorFlow 2.x and PyTorch backend."
