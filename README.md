Stashing graph libraries I come across (mostly just Python ones)

## Graph kernels/comparisons
- [graphkit-learn](https://github.com/jajupmochi/graphkit-learn)
  - "A python package for graph kernels, graph edit distances, and graph pre-image problem."

## Graph embeddings
- [OpenNE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNE)
  - "This repository provides a standard NE/NRL(Network Representation Learningï¼‰training and testing framework. In this framework, we unify the input and output interfaces of different NE models and provide scalable options for each model. Moreover, we implement typical NE models under this framework based on tensorflow, which enables these models to be trained with GPUs."
  
## Graph neural networks
- [GraphGallery](https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/GraphGallery)
  - "GraphGallery is a gallery for benchmarking Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Adversarial Learning with TensorFlow 2.x and PyTorch backend."
- [cogdl](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl)
  - "CogDL is a graph representation learning toolkit that allows researchers and developers to easily train and compare baseline or custom models for node classification, link prediction and other tasks on graphs. It provides implementations of many popular models, including: non-GNN Baselines like Deepwalk, LINE, NetMF, GNN Baselines like GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE."


## Temporal
- [PyTorch Geometric Temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal)

## Diffusion
- [NDLib](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti/ndlib)
   - "Network Diffusion Library - (for NetworkX and iGraph)" 

## Community Detection
- [CDLib](https://github.com/GiulioRossetti/cdlib)
   - "Community Discovery Library - (for networkx and igraph)"
